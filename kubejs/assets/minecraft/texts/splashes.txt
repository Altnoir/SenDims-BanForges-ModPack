EL PSY KONGROO
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Remember me to the one who lives there,
She was once the true love of mine.
He was once the true love of mine.
To the MOON!
Remember Ashes to Ashes?
Remember RePalmon?
Show you the White Lightning!
To listen, to feel, to think.
Countless Possibilities
Be a great thinker. 
I hate Weakly Typed.
Here comes the General!
